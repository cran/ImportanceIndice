Description: The Percentage of Importance Indice (Percentage_I.I.) bases in magnitudes, frequencies, and distributions of occurrence of an event (DEMOLIN-LEITE, 2021) <http://scielo.sld.cu/pdf/cjas/v55n2/2079-3480-cjas-55-02-e10.pdf>. This index can detect the key loss sources (L.S) and solution sources (S.S.), classifying them according to their importance in terms of loss or income gain, on the productive system. The Percentage_I.I. = [(ks1 x c1 x ds1)/SUM (ks1 x c1 x ds1) + (ks2 x c2 x ds2) + (ksn x cn x dsn)] x 100. key source (ks) is obtained using simple regression analysis and magnitude (abundance). Constancy (c) is SUM of occurrence of L.S. or S.S. on the samples (absence = 0 or presence = 1), and distribution source (ds) is obtained using chi-square test. This index has derivations: i.e., i) Loss estimates and solutions effectiveness and ii) Attention and non-attention levels (DEMOLIN-LEITE,2024) <DOI: 10.1590/1519-6984.253215>.
